        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a wonderful pineapple dish to be served with ham.</p>
        <p>It is a favorite at Easter in my family. The egg whites add a touch of lightness to it.</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs, whites and yolks seperated</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <Li>½ cup butter</Li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
            <li>3 cups cubed bread</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 C).</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form.
                Lift your beater or whish straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.
            </li>

            <li>Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in a large bowl.
                Stir in the pineapple and bread. Lightly fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread the mixture into a large baking dish.
            </li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, for 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
